Welcome to my page. I am a current CS master's student at Georgia Tech specializing in Machine Learning Computer Vision. My current interests include 3D computer vision and geometry estimation, as well as 3D scene reconstruction through rendering (like NeRF, 3DGS, and variants). I will be working on a research project under James Hays starting this spring semester, as well as working as a GTA for CS 4476: Computer Vision.

Previously, I did my undergrad at UC Berkeley, where I double-majored in Computer Science and Applied Math. After completion, I worked as a visiting researcher at [KAUST](https://kaust.edu.sa) where I was able to publish a paper on optimization methods in ML under the guidance of Peter Richtarik.

In my spare time, I love to go out, travel, and try new types of food. I also love hiking and nature; if you happen to know some good trails and/or spots, please do not feel afraid to suggest them to me. I also really enjoy board games like chess and different card games. I am also a big fan of sci-fi and fantasy shows, especially the old Star Trek shows and (some of) the movies.
Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.
